taking from back my distinguished colleagues here said the demand for talent now he still every country are most countries now want the best touts corot him starting from china to india to singapore to malaysia how are embedded in the water these countries that are looking for the best talons and there are very few good talents either established korean counts so first of all work and qatar offered to the young people and they stopped people to attract them here and develop two outstanding group of scientists in qatar that's going to be a major challenge the second one i would say is what i call a stag puppies so stuff is always say monster now i go to rotter meetings he doesn't matter where from stockholm to singapore to tokyo or anywhere else i don't know i hear something new he says stop being told time and time again sometime i add even a better april in the top ten years ago one other things in my view qatar has to follow he's actually take some race we say the payoff is going to be significant by mental recently said you're going to areas where that and the breakthroughs are going to be very very significant i do not tank in the worst water neatly use and that i would stand at these holland research you'll make break to make an incremental changes what the real breakthrough will come looking at that same problem coptic you differently i give you one example and you've ten years ago tank me that a company could be king has a net producer at rutter i study must be joking if you look outside the bags no nestle one thirty six largest company at the world when you have nestle plans at net rata clarity that you really are contemplating rats baronet rather than consuming rutter as they used to do something that a problem differently if they are different mindset we can achieve our goals and this is what i like to suggest that do don't do that two hundred others are doing and you are not going to stop these yourself has the leader in that just one of the answer ads but if you do walk major breakthrough you can make fundamental difference not only to qatar the world as a whole by contributing something thank you very very wise i think we must stoner so as i mentioned to him trying to wreak results or basic resets and you to critics sad and it's much more difficult than average in papers translate any basic research into patients site was important sign test photo that in two science or scientists we need to bring many other talents people specialized in ethics patents intellectual properties regulations we need to get gration welcome or so it is in the case of u s f d in japan's pnds in europe it's so we had experts and aggressions we need to have experts in public communications so two or a t train all those people some to scientists albus we just five years ago we had many good science around that we didn't had those non scientific superb tames you know experts expressing her tent grayson essex and so i think it is very important ian vance to make a team scientists as a center that many other talents as supporting team after that right well i have actually the opportunity not only give you my personal perspective but qatar at the moment is in the fight in time where we are recruiting talent the questions that i asked them as part of our discussion is what attracted you to take the first step and i would say that as my case but also the case when you think in terms that when nasa said the department of energy national labs where people are attracted to tackling important challenges signs the scientific discoveries at life's work it's not a job it's a career where you wake up in the morning you're trying to soul interesting challenges you have to attract it to the problem and i think that some of the problems that we have discussed today not only problems of qatar what this is global challenges that required the kind of dedication that that you can bring to bear only thing that they attracted to his world class infrastructure a commitment by the leadership where where you're focused on making a difference leapfrogging and as i said i believe he to look beyond the corner and takes him for this and so having the opportunity to be here around people with the resources of course but really important problems well fast infrastructure colleagues that our second to none this is the kind of things that really attack come here and actually some of the challenges of be had by it and defied in terms of going through the purposes of identifying the challenges really looked hard to see these things where we can make more transformative act better little incremental impact because i don't think these are mutually exclusive these we need to pursue the mental advances but also transformative advances and i think that is opportunity he had and that's what attracts people to come here i wish we had more time because there's a lot of brilliance here on this stage and very well spoken think you are that we must conclude the session thank you for a very stimulating beginning or the sessions that will follow and we are officially concluded thank you tell him i say that damn vm mcnicol aim of adults i have its demo can i do
