the and took an expanded that memo about time kids there are three hundred and fifty million people affected so he's a channel was always because it's not something that you can put your payment will go away may facts and if you ever have to cut you fast who have problems has a mountain pewter and a person with that will cost the has such between for to ten times person so you can understand also form an economic spent a lot of have panicking because people are working with system cannot they have system can cost ten times married person so anyway session so this is the number one challenge for khatab where the dismantling there's a habitable twenty to twenty four percent referees much higher than any other countries well girls between six to eight percent so clearly challenge that the country's focusing on we will benefit me have strong and the noun strikers to that acid at what's happening in would say that to help with that situation if you look at the handlers that they have two types diapers in type tunes so we'll have some of our speaker will talk about type one that demand cefn from dressler will talk about the advances that i do in the area of pharmaceutical for type ones which is usually very important for people it 's life threatening and i really have dr gannon doctor for granted as some i whereas about how to handle the type to so that we will talk about social in tatters this surgery has to do with type two years and then that are forgotten is going to come and talk about personalized medicine for type two which you heard this morning from professor lemon akerson said that personalized medicine seems to boot to go i'm going to turn red session i got a mother that i do have a stroke or shuttle mimics then we'll have five minutes for a cure by the time i lend them have the paired with that's my responsibility this morning the thing i like to move about the technologies and new technologies is that there was a technology that we all felt that that's it but we can help people with tattoos it's the tac you can bet that caffeine calories and actually can get a designer bland shoes from a better tile tells them that can be too had themselves as technologies are coming i can do something i would like to remind you have said the back of my mind coming sometimes that a complex expense for them have done a good time and cost i've been able to an end in qatar at the reverence to have month you can down the community and the contestants bureau from says that they'll granny has gotten is the premier and science at the semi may have been shambolic in trouble he got from the federal should be shared with flu canada after ratty were sold and run fellowship with me three are pretty good will june through paris and because center in massachusetts compassion he was heavily involved with a minimally invasive surgeon reverb man to end thrust at the coolant clinic has been behead them to social center and he jumped man about after exposure to the perelman said betterment contributions in the shoot performance it has over two hundred and fifty two published books tractor many western surgeon and we were too though has read the connection that again thank you very much of this nice introduction i think i was here two years ago we will try to catch up with what has been done since so title of my talk is is metabolomics surgery for mass treatment pursed about i would like to make a smaller nounced meant i will be president of the two thousand and fourteen which is the international federation of surgery of obesity and metabolism surgery will have their world congress in montreal idea of august two thousand and fourteen and we will be discussing surgery for diabetes the time in this year we have really four types of surgery that are used or busy so that's different than type two diabetes and we have lagged ban sligo stretched to me gastric bypass and doodling or switch these are four types of surgery that are currently being done worldwide but they have deepened extract on weight the lab ban has about ten points about my send acts decrease and if you look at gastric bypass it's almost more than fifteen and dude switch here close to twenty points about imagined acts and it's proportional to the reversal of diabetes banding will give about fifty percent bypass more than eighty percent and do they know switch almost one hundred percent so the more weight loss we have the more diabetes resolution and this corresponds to decrease in cat mass and therefore decrease in insulin resistance makes a lot of sense so the best weight lost his wit do the switch and the best diabetes resolution is with bpd not switch this is the classic bpd which has a gastrectomy and a connection to the lower heart of the intestine we therefore bring the school much faster to the distal smile about this is a switch which is a violent at this operation and the gastrectomy is vertical instead of being horizontal but it also brings the food to the last portion of the intestine much faster that increase and changes the resolution of type two diabetes i at least it is proposed we are different studies that have been done looking at the type two diabetes this is a meta analysis using the patients who do not meet an ice cream area and in this multimedia asserts we see that the percentage a resolution of diabetes over all its more than fifty percent but with bending less than thirty mini gastric bypass the sleek  trek to me than runway gastric bypass and then there's a new procedure called sleep gastrectomy with illegal transposition this is the old swedish obesity study which is probably one of the best long term cohort comparing surgical treatment and best medical treatment if you want your running shoes this is the running shoes here on top and after ten years the weight has not change and surgery here whether it's bending vertical  applies to your gastric bypass it's the percent of weight change and there is also a change in diabetes and that you have here after this time four percent of diabetes after ten years in control versus seven percent in surgery you could look at a period of fifteen years the patients in this to swedish obesity study and we look at these the number of diabetics that have appeared over fifteen years is two hundred and ninety two versus one hundred and ten in surgery if you look at this statistically we see that twenty eight percent twenty eight diabetes per one thousand happened in control group versus in surgery on the six point eight per one thousand and they are random i study this study compared ban versus best medical treatment and after two years there was seventy three percent complete resolution of diabetes versus thirteen percent in the control arm this is the new england journal of medicine steer this compared biometric surgery versus intensive medical treatment and industry a change in himalayan a one c in control versus either sleek has trekked to me or gastric bypass was dramatically lights when a surgical group there was also the average medication did not change in a control group but in surgical group dramatically life and this is also the change in body weight certainly between those two operation there was no difference in the same issue there was another study from catholic university and cornell looking at buyer utrecht surgery versus best medical treatment for type two diabetes this one was a two years telling you can see here the best medical treatment in the drop of hemoglobin anyone see at two years versus gastric bypass and again bpd which is the one i mentioned to your before giving the best weight loss two years the dose two groups gastric bypass  bpd were also significantly different so in conclusion that study in severe obese patients with type two diabetes bariatric surgery resulted in better glucose control than did medical therapy b p d resulted in better drew costs controlling gastric bypass we look at five in ten year study a weight loss comparing dvds and doodling or switch do they not switch gives better weight loss than bp it also has less complete reversal after ten years and a number of revisions in bpd are quite high twenty four percent versus four percent in doodling switch and for revisions are listed here and bpd mostly for mother tricia and the wall nds only mainly for insufficient weight loss we can conclude that doodling or switch is a better operation than b p for all the reason mentioned here and we believed that do the switch is good operation for type two diabetes this idea mercy of chicago day compare doing or switch versus runway gastric bypass and the resolution of diabetes was one hundred percent india's versus sixty percent in were no i gastric bypass also similarly for hypertension and dyslipidemia when dr myself on convexity which has ninety six ninety eight percent up in the province of quebec look at fifteen years experience of doing or switch he had resolution of type two diabetes in ninety two percent after fifteen years so the conclusion of that was that do they now switch is the best operations for type two diabetics not gastric bypass there is a problem with gastric bypass is that type two diabetes can come back one percent here in this study developed refractory new onset of diabetes seven to nine years after gastric bypass in this study from columbia university reemergence of diabetes after gastric bypass in mid to long term all of and in fact those that had recurrence of type two diabetes in this line had less weight loss in percentage today recurred or worse in the experience of columbia university about twenty four percent recurred awards from after gastric bypass and in this one four thousand four hundred adults with type two diabetes who had gastric bypass they see thirty five percent we develop diabetes within five years so when you look at the silver pair that ten years only forty four percent of patients with type two diabetes or cured with gastric bypass versus ninety two percent would do no switch at fifteen years and it's a problem when you want to transform a gastric bypass to do the now switch because it's a very complex operation you have to undo the gastric bypass restored in atoms and then do it do now switch so this is only perform very rarely so it is better to choose these patients and do switch but is it reasonable to do do the on switch on as a first intention certainly no because it's too complex operation we would rather say do asleep as an ideal first operation sleeve is the first part of the deal switch and we can always give doing else which for trailers which leave in type two diabetes may be around twenty percent sleeve is an easy easier operation to perform in has lower mortality and morbidity and it has a high resolution of type two diabetes it has a low micro nutrient deficient fees and it's much easier to re operate is in body mass index more than sixty hour first experience with sleek has trekked to me for type two diabetes and it had resolution in six close to terms of patients in one quarter they were ameliorated the study of the university of barcelona type two diabetes had equal resolution to bypass one year later and in taiwan where they do a strict to me in low body mass index mainly type two diabetes patients average body mass index was only thirty one and after one year was twenty five close to normal they had a drop of email give anyone see from ten point one to seven point one over that period of time and you can see the resolution increases as time goes by which trigger stretched to me also dependent on their see peptide now in this cuddy that compare bypass and streakers trek to me at two years between bypass and sleep the resolution of type two diabetes was quite high and equal two groups also the resolution there cardiovascular risk was similar in both ipatient sleep this is another randomized trial comparing sleeping gastric bypass and there was also a drop of immigrants one a one c and and weight but in this randomized trial this league was not done properly this one is from the cleveland clinic it's called tempi trial and it looked at best medical treatment versus biometric surgery for type two diabetes and in the surgical group they were sleek has trekked to me versus bypassing the bottom is that they were more female patients in the scheme has trekked to me gastric bypass so this was a strange random vision but nevertheless when they'll look at glucose measured in a mixed orange tests over several months medical treatment glucose and i in gastric bypass it peaks earlier and then it drops down to normal sleeve is in between when we look at sea pettite there was no difference between gastric bypass and sleeker strict to me and this is there the controlled and there was no different sceptically at two years between sligo stretched to me and were no i gastric bypass so in the stampede trial what we've learned is that surgery has better resolution than type two diabetes as another randomized study that was published recently by patrolling and it looked at runway gastric bypass  tricked me and there was no explanation the omagh index between the two operation was here's the glucose curve of ruined by gastric bypass persistently this is the instrument production between the two operation say that even the peek into in production was higher which league has trekked to me this is the grassland gerland was lower which we get stuck to me compare to run why gastric bypass and she was higher in peaks then intrigue gastric to me l p one was likely better in which we're in right gastric bypass than which triggers trek to me and p r it was about the same in this more recent study five years of  trek to me from ohio there was one hundred percent resolution at five years of type two diabetes with sleeker strictly we diabetes recurrence we have options after sleek a stricter me we can do some of these new operations like aerial into position we take a segment of alien and we placed this more proximal we can do at doing or switch we can do a single and asked moses stewarding switch we can do a dude bypass and we can recently so there's a lot of option in two thousand and five are we gave an app hypothesis that if we take a segment of villian and we put it here more proximal to the joke track or even between the stomach and even between his offer guests from stomach that we would have a nearly stimulation of hormones and a resolution or type this was in two thousand and five and apollo in brazil did this in humans also by putting a segment here at alien or even between the dude intimate alien and in brazilian population there remission of diabetes with imogen anyone see less than sex was eighty one percent in these diabetics in japan they do or do they know journal bypass combined with the sleeve result of diabetes in ninety six percent in the japanese population we know that there's like two hundred and fifty million people and the planet and this is a problem in two thousand and fifteen we have a manpower problem because we currently do about one percent of all day surgical candidates streak aspect to me is probably the best procedure for this that hold its effectiveness at five years operation for diabetes it's already can be offered as a two stage procedure of core body mass index modern fifty and if the type two diabetes recur we can do other types of operation added to this week s tricked me so i truly believed that she guessed tricked me will be much popular and done faster in the near future thank you very much
