questions yes one their spectacular will takes is that the energy back time so the amount of energy we use is going to produce at least ten times more energy in the future the lifetime of these parents is very very important when it has shown so if we are using the nuba the fossil fuels today if it can dedicated to one percent of the revenue two words peary we can get a lot done or gross men men men pop about those who know though you can do take some of the subsidies away and give it into into for the little tired intact any of them are possible pathways that given mind all of them are policy instruments we don't want to do policy we want to do science and technology have been used the methods of science where there's computing sciences physical sciences chemical sciences pilot sickle sciences or even social sciences rather than say hey you have to take to pursue there are natural gas or any other fossil fuels and put it back into any other questions yes and thank you for emphasizing social science and fidelity india polygamist but i think that we have to go a little beyond neighbor imitating the neighbor in terms of the societal aspect some very valuable research on mentor models and how the cognitive ability of people to accept or reject innovation and i think we should focus in terms of basic research or on mentor models cognitive capacity and acceptance of such are innovate not simply trying to get a tv from the neighbor completely i kept a good the murderous fantastic point coming while i'm a condensed matter physicists for us to even be able to think about social sciences was a leap of faith the good will be on that  gladly what you're saying i totally agree with you yes are well are our mission you mentioned potential use of like a solar fuels for story do we send that but unity simply for you why they use of solar energy as a source of energy in chemical industry resembled transition process is using a solar fairness also your for poor countries you 're going to already now what days as citric knowledge has developed for solar organs for cooking basically direct use of sunlight of four where i definitely quiche and then recurrent to use the energy generated from fossil fuels completely isolated i so let's there any directed efforts to do it and within the u s the answer is no i can tell you there was a colleague of mine at long sparky who was doing stuff like this heb in bangladesh for example sermo powered rich us so that you don't have to keep peddling all the time the questions have different the technology led will required is very different the cost structure is very different what we were looking at a spot of department of energy was looking at electricity generation impacting the broad scale electricity generation there was a lot of universes which are under pitifully in terms of technology deployment that you can look into using solar for in a heating water heating quest yes sir i will repeat your quest otherwise or the microphone is taking time to there is the question look back and looked far at twenty years what do you see that cost of solar following twenty or so until it is going to be less than dollar award when he started sunshine that i remembered this debate with steve too steep tart that we were being through aggressive and i was haunting the table and say no we want to be very aggressive and now we take by twenty seventeen will hit dollar award courtesy of course of the chinese manufacturing the price of panels have dropped like a pericles almost like a face transition and then the peripheral costs are also dramatically lowered now that there were two years ago so i have no doubt like now that you'll see saw were at less than dollar what but just a kid forget twenty twenty three years ok i think we're fashionably late a death thanks to your doctor around with you try that amazing presentation i'd like to welcome to stage now don 't try to share you've come to university at staring in the u k whole talk to us about water security
