you are and as x and sees distinguished colleagues gas i thought of all i'd like to say what pleasure it is to make my is it to qatar quite a regular visits to the area to your neighbors to the south the emirate i've been looking polls this it's a dough hospital for some considerable time i want to do is to give a bird's eye view of the world of materials and i'd like to on the line the point that materials gee that straddles many of your strategic goals here in qatar and indeed many of the and challenges that your highness outlined earlier and if we look at the challenges of the twenty one st century and we're all familiar with the material psalms impacts on virtually all of the some of them may not be quite so obvious and others hall but if you look at the role of  day in the impacts of materials all around us computers owns our cars aircraft not so in classical structural materials or smart materials in electronics and so on what's also in medicine health so materials play a very important role such as lasers to surgery and the been dramatic improvement for example that implants hip replacements and song all of these are based on developments in the tyrol science and if you look back over the last thirty years it's interesting today seeing what's happening where might imagine that well you know things happened rather slowly but led being some dramatic discoveries in last thirty years through them here but there are many of them have been recognized already with nobel prize as kavli prizes and so on i'll just mention one thing who would have imagined as ago that we will discovered three new forms of carbon everybody would have known about diamond everybody would have known about graph eye and yet in the last thirty years we've discovered three hundred mentally new forms of carbon which never existed before and have unique properties so new material open new opportunity i'd like to stay a little bit within the theme of the conference about technologies for energy and materials for energy connect with the meeting by saying a few words about some of the activities in so let's cells and batteries i also want to stress not only energy generation and energy storage but the importance of energy conservation saws so a few words about solid state lighting you look at solar energy of course what we're trying to do is capture the energy that falls on the service surface which is shown in red on the chart here if you see how it active we are with modern solar cells the simple solar cells such as silicon solar cell only capture attraction in order to capture the other parts of the spectrum the infrared and the ultra biologics we need to go to much more complex semiconductor systems triple junction cells and song which worked wonderfully well what's also extremely expensive and there will be talks about this call pick to noon allowing sessions how other also other ways of doing this through materials instead of building body complex semiconductor systems we could use materials to take some of the emperor ed light a move its into the visible by up conversion all taking pilot light move into the weak spots are was simple silicon photovoltaic cell so there are many different ways of approaching this the good news while the gigawatts goal is that things are getting better i won't go through the complex charles here it's simply the efficiency of different types of solar cells as a puncture of time and you can see that  progress is being made let me just say something about rechargeable lithium batteries the rechargeable lithium battery didn't say thirty years ago it was the real breakthrough came with work of john goading off in oxford and he developed and others following him the classical lithium metal oxide batteries which you use cell phones or computers and so on they work very well but they don't contain a lot of energy there are harvest systems that are coming prominence now such as literally himself a battery which can deliver much more energy the potential of lithium sulphur is contacted and lucky mare battery which is even more uterus theoretical maximum which is all does of magnitude better than the ones that were using at the moment just on the line the nature of the problem here if she wants to power a car rather than a cell town then the chevy volt for example which was the first one use to be driven where it's possible to drive it just on the battery though it's a hybrid it has a battery which is about four hundred pounds in weight nearly two hundred kilograms you can see it's almost as big as the ceo of general motors yet it has a range of forty mile and so you need an enormous battery to go very short distance because these materials a not terribly the new has were beautiful car made in california actually is completely based upon a battery has a range of three hundred miles up to three hundred miles of the top of the range system take several hours to charge at home it has an enormous battery the whole of the chassis of the car is a battery and of course the other thing to bury nine on this was already been illustrated with wallet two incidence there's a lot of energy and this battery and so if something goes wrong can have serious consequences costs and so on last week about generations of lighting and where we are with lighting this is about energy conservation we've moved on crumbly use millions of years ago to light things through candles lamb the edison light bulb we are all familiar with and for about the last decade well so we part in tolley solid state lighting and the solid state lighting is replacing the last digit back home to technology which used to fill all radios and televisions and so the bakken light is on its way out from being replaced by all solid state bay systems the white l e d well actually lose the white l e d s not a while he d it's actually a blue l e d and so what developed by shooting aca more than a cheer now you'd see santa barbara was the missing color in the visible spectrum but the modern why italy use the blue ill and then we use other materials to change the color from blue to yellow to red and green so that you can fill out the visible spectrum and so this was making it mandelson pack electricity about twenty percent of our electricity in the world is used for lighting and with solid state lighting we could potentially reduce the electricity consumption because of the greater efficiency by about fifty percent so that represents ten percent world's electricity generation which could be so energy conservation is very important it's starting to appear in our lives and this is one of the great triumph recent trance of material science so i hope is you develop your strategy and going to the detail you recognize that new materials create new opportunities for the future and that this would be a wonderful direction to the cutter foundation for with one the pin not only the energy area let's also health area information technology data storage and things like that your highness exxon sees ladies and gentlemen thank you very much indeed thank you thank you are the thing was panel members this was a very engaging panel without coordinated amongst ourselves we find that doctors ask a riot set the stage for the challenges in the goals here in qatar and then we had some very interesting research topics disgust on personalized medicine in on what a male which meant in desalination and on materials which impacts everything so don't have a lot of time left i'm going to ask one question and we'll go back in reverse order i 'm going to cheat and maybe real several questions into one education the unique setting apparatus that you mentioned there of course challenges to achieve them and there was a time frame and so i'm interested to know red as widows deck roadblock that needs to be addressed and you can gless on a time frame them right next second part of that is how do we develop the research talent here in qatar to help address those kinds of things and turn that leadership into global leadership start with you professor tomb i think i would dressed second question because i think developing research  coming in many other countries best talents is engraved demand and of course when the film so much excellent sands in countries where it's twenty years ago knots in the forefront of sand so you see the growth of science in china for example and the other rapidly in countries that i think is wonderful level on says can grumble if more great so answers being down however of course it means that the demand for once and for the top talent is very high and it's in limited supply and so i think carter kunduz as humans its financial muscle to compete with other countries around the world i go to the emirates regularly there are developments there in the materials area i also adviser at cows in saudi arabia and these countries are competing for the same international talent in the end of course you need to be developing your own talents hearing carter and that's quite a long journey exciting that it's the way and every confidence that over the next decade you make very importance in roads in that challenge
