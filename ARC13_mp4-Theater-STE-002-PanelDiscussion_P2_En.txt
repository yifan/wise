your highness your highness distinguished guests interment it 's a great honor to be here to attend annual conference or qatar condition my very fast time careening qatar my white and i went to the desert yesterday and we had a chance to write care we really enjoy thank you and that's in the next five minutes we do you that changing medicine those two genome sequencing stem cells so let me begin genome sequencing in two thousand and then president of the night knighted tape and the prime minister u k tony blair sellable reason or tracked human sequencing human genome project was in nineteen nineties it was to be it an ass now collaboration in human history including many countries you uk japan france germany and spain and china the total budget was about u s three billion dollars a lot of money so as i mentioned that was completed in two thousand and the purpose of this project is to determine the secret whole humans one past and it's completed in two thousand so just take the form of a one person to what on ten years three billion u s it required many times in many countries we are now even two thousand and thirteen it's been only ten years after the complete them human genome project now when the colony technorati we can do the same you can see the same goal within two weeks one so then you so this means we can determine you on because within two weeks the other technology i want to introduce you stem cell technology in nine hundred and eighty one of time king stem cells mouse embryos are celt embryonic stem cells he had what i'm saying we expand  as much as we want then we can combat yourselves into many types of some attic including brain cells hot cells labour cells and so in cute out and setting we can make our own the same potential he sells the procedure is very thin for or we need is a sample so i'd win or blood samples we can reprogram them on that cells which nearly indistinguishable from yesterday we need the i p a selves years selves tell you can make your own ideas it's very simple detailed two or three months it called one what do you thought them your spouse and i just made them now you own the blueprint of our body so we can make our own stem cells from goods we can make many types of kinetic tells including playing selves heartfelt when creative so we can make on graphic cells from patients suffering from diabetes making ikea we can make great old run basin suffering from parkinson's disease you your own medicine is now changing conventional medicine to past eyes medicine we have been doing incumbents are no medicine we develop a bear acted near track some diseases such as diabetes in combustion are made did the same to all the patient some patients can be treating with this topic that other pitch black paid is not a tactic that means that paid can cause i'm tethers excited text and heart it may called it'll are eaten we have been doing in conventional medicine i know in your own genome sequencing and by making your pancreatic cells cells we should be able to keep predict if any new dropped and also you can use to be able to predict tide africa ducks parklands the medicine this is that we are now time we buy sequencing information genome information function by utilizing i guess they'll technology we 're going to men will be most effective remi most take for each basic sanitation years eight will either patient where we do use ducky christians you said that we are going to use them cell therapy patients suffering from in the next decade i think about we want to say in conventional medicine we want to achieve the parcel eyes medicine happen everywhere including qatar thank you should show the little puffer soul so i bought the summer had keller scientists let me talk we can add and that is he says a prequel to visit to doha as an adviser could have government but i have not been to doha for about thirty years when he had a day i tell cyclic ben winkle slipping or thirty years and waking up and looking at a completely me war what you have done your high mesquite in the last twenty types with thirty years if you can do it either more the next thirty years the future is indeed right i'll make points tourism rotter security has an important topic i think i can stokely say in the in two thousand and fourteen that number gribble rates that would be identified would be water security on the right track but at the same time i'd like to run you that water security and water crisis business with a lot of collateral understanding hand lot of me in march fruit twenty second a march this year the world water day i googled how many item child find on water crisis and honey second that march because run one hundred and fifty two million items this morning out of curiosity got up and how many i can't wings two hundred and thirty three million items on water crisis in the last month's hello and i would make two if you throw her most at those actually ninety percent that there's too on in the congo pollute the many that is seriously what do you want me sending out so that you need to do or the car needs to be nature do has to be out of the ordinary and i want to share with you some of that things that are happening we have to change the world completely within the next ten or fifteen years which most people have very little idea why most people would have had barely fill idea because that i'll andy has changed and is changing very very lucky i currently advice nineteen cover mints including a few prime ministers ministers and a couple of kings hand rubber reason i answered rise you solve the world's largest corporation  within that torture and chief tea past fifty companies of the world that had i am i have seen now is arlen d has now woke folly while from the universities and research institutions to large corporations i had not realized that how much it is until i started advising the seven seas q companies now with the annual budget research project running tat six and a half billion dollars and it is increasing steadily each year not noise single in your city anyway which has is that tight make men of six and a half billion dollars each year and increasing in addition the dependence i see is if i can convince and when she to do research for a can twenty years time that money is forthcoming as long as you get to the some benchmarks but on the negative chide what they are doing very few people and are obvious reasons they want to make money which is very which why they're spending when it and until they have started out there you won't know what they do not just want to share with you to die times which was r d in the area up disorientation i am convinced we did the next ten fifteen years you'll see completely new way or be celebrating water not with high energy but by biomimicry what do i mean by biomimicry that companies now spending hundreds of millions of dollars to go through biomimicry biomimicry very simple hi guys mangrove which grow on salt water desalination water in its body how does nature doing how does and a government species of cash which more trashed water to solve corker and back to crash water again how those anna dramas stretches of patients these selling at water in order to survive within that body ngos are measured research efforts that are going on creature completely evolution eyes water availability within the next ten to fifteen years well q people know what they're doing whatever cheat i will go run more example when he appeal must have seen lotus leaves he says he's kidding lotus leaves i said he wants to be crazy what money is there on law has tape is a kind of minute you have lost range it  on the lotus leaf like grout mockery right when it completely disappeared and that is as dry as ever he said look if i can create an out easy the sales capture that makes the switch and less or is it some chemical that makes his affection less our water if i can't do that kink about humping rats pumping oil i were treated less price which will take our most anywhere you want with available energy those that happening we don't know very much about it talked about rotter and coat security well again i tell you some of these companies start looking at carbon dioxide irrigation you'll say you must be joking how do you really get with short you will take a country like qatar which is a lot of gaffes if you can capture the carbon dioxide and using off use include production water requirement goes down white ninety nine percent so these are not things that are happening and revelation king start happening in the signs cyclical cruel c within ten fifteen years and i am per one reasonably optimistic even though i see now a big problem or its water we say now eight hundred million people do not have access to water my response to that is a bunch of billotti those triggers actually nearly three billion in this world do not have access to safe water not a hundred million but even if we look at the world situation in twenty twenty nine point two billion people food needs to energize their aspirations that i trained changes we the crocker as i see signs and technology happening you can't parts of the work it recording the right way had managed water the right way we don't hyper one do do not see any problem i am cautiously optimistic about the world each year ham cautiously optimistic that by twenty by two thousand and thirty twenty five t will reliving in a completely different way of science and technology so i concrete rent your highness and the qatar foundation the parts you are going i wish you much success because you have showing the part and i'm quite sure you will work only well to contribute not only to the qatar for the world as a whole hank you very much
