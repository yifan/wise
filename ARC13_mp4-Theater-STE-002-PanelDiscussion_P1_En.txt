we use them their own channel but she told me the next round should have been the arabic would really about now we're living in asham at the well known of goods that had been the combined just saying swelled remarks globally now i would like to turn the social dr dennis  joan <unk> and ribbon more national laboratory shown trouble session this morning good morning your excellencies distinguished gaffes i am pleased to be among you today and tomorrow rate the panel titled facing challenges international experiences and cutters opportunities at its core research is about taking important challenges and turning them into opportunities research opportunities you will hear disgust over the next two days could help improve human life and the health of the environment they are opportunities that will benefit the region and potentially impact science on a global scale i would be remiss if i did not convey how computing can help accelerate scientific discovery and overcome roadblocks to progress computers have become differentiating tools or discovery and innovation contributing to advancements in groundbreaking science across a broad set of challenges that would previously considered impossible for example in the last year a team of livermore and ivy him scientists created a code called cardio that has produced the world's most detailed simulation of the human heart really an unsurprising that fastest supercomputer in the world cardio replicates the heart's electrical system that originates from and travels through the heart causing it to beat for the first time fairly detailed heart models can be run quickly enough to examine how potentially fatal arrhythmias how they develop and how they are influenced by the administration of drugs and the use of medical devices this research shows the promise of advanced computing and how it can help turn challenges into extraordinary opportunity this morning you will hear about specific challenges that like understanding the inter workings of the human heart global ramifications and when salt will provide uniquely transformative advances toward the human race i would now like to introduce the esteemed members of the panel thereby ivory fees in the program and their accomplishments are many so let me only introduced them by name as i call your name if you will please come to the stage dr thomas was acura executive vice president of research and development kutcher town asian for education science and community development professor and no ballet shinya yamanaka central researching application he'll tell university japan and the gladstone institute hilton season san francisco professor anthony cheatham and the united kingdom and professor as their birth centered for water management mexico the league kwan new school for public policy each about palace making a short presentation and then afterwards time permitting we will have a discussion among ourselves panelist may choose to speak from their seat or from the podium first panelists his doctor soccer right good morning but to be part of this panel thank you that it has donna for the kind tinted action your highness your excellencies distinguish fests colleagues and friends good morning to you and welcome to then or research conference next fare aperture unity to discuss the challenges and indeed the opportunities that faces qatar in research and development and also highly can interact with their colleagues from overseas international escalettes later talent clearly science as your highness you mention is a member and and we add best yet leadership in terms of thank you an actual recess strategy we are indeed building leading research and innovation ecosystem in the brief five minutes or so that i had to do i want to touch tatar plan three key points one is translating signs to innovation the opportunity to create a girl nexus or scientific talent and cut the connector to the global scientific enterprise bring economic clusters so impactful sciences your highness you announced today the three grand challenges in energy water and cyber these are three important problems with tremendous challenges but also it presents cut out an opportunity to not only create solutions for these projects and important problems locally by that but unity to leapfrog technologically and in serving create opportunities for new businesses in her drive two words a knowledge base diversified economy so let me just quickly around those key challenges that key areas of scientific priorities or teams an energy security your highness you announce that game clearly this represents an opportunity for qatar not only saw the scientific challenges but create new technologies and new opportunities that the energy and the growth in the glade at that scale requires not only new technologies in terms of energy two elektra energy but what you sow storage and also the idea of smart glade or powder like tonics and perhaps even gretel as distribution of energy if it can fraction of that energy is consumed by our production of de salted water indeed these nations as had been the river cut out but whiting valuable for sustaining life fia and cut the we have a challenge to grow food from today to much larger fraction which will again at stress to the rather a bird's eye national i have anybody had an aquifer but are so desalination and indeed we want to do it in a sustainable fashion finally i'd have to fix key challenges in terms of diabetes hypertension coronary these cultural regional better so environmental food water and energy ramifications for these are interconnected trouble and of course we have today a hydrocarbon base economy and we provide a bed thirty percent of the natural gas for the entire world and its i was possibility to be good stewards and have in a hyperconnected world make sure that these infrastructure as well as a cyber total cyber infrastructure q so in many ways these interesting and challenging challenge the problems that offers us an opportunity i really believed to leapfrog in number of important technological areas a tattered but creating a nexus of scientific talent here it is critical that we in order to achieve and that we need to develop mirka talent here that ticker lee ph d talent here in cutter your highness you announced recently they've got their foundation ph d program and we have started with three students jointly with a high politics in hama had been khalifa university and working with cut our university to expand this program so that in the fumes that time we will develop marco talents here working on the problems that are of interest cut that so very important to attract internationally talent near term and strengthen our international linkages to our colleagues you and the panel but there are some more broadly as muscle fibers rady mentioned creating a rare class and wine mid for scientific development here both in terms of research infrastructure but also the kind of environment that is needed to nurture talent and solutions this cut our foundation resets talent with industry and academia we want to even from each other researchers being formed by the challenges of industry and our stakeholders and it should be guided by the challenges facing the country have to promote science to young people in the end we have to reach out to students in schools in middle school and high school so that they had enameled by science a day see scientists as role models that they see that this is that they can spend an entire could or you because as many suffices said science takes a long time dedication to solving sometimes problems that takes an entire for you and if of course essentials to build and sustain a pipeline of out and the talent and articulate aim is to diversify the economy by growing economic clusters through these impactful science we wanted to have focus on the investments in a grand challenges to develop deep knowledge and capability that is required for the domestic industry as well as blurred the solutions global challenges actively engaged industry to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer in both directions we cannot do research in a vacuum ok technology challenge we cannot do research in a vacuum we these three said after be informed by the challenges that face local industry but also the solutions and the new technologies that we develop must be quickly and safely transferred to industry we also must expand that innovation capacities that will allow us to enhance said they were t to recruit talent a significant but sector eye and investment in a diversify their condoms we were many researchers to be in the private sector but take all these multimedia meant a prize and so it's my expectation my goal my vision that cut their foundation out and d will be the catalyst for the valid thing there's diversified economic clusters challenges and affairs when we created this kind of environment this kind of art and d it closest them we expect that multinationals that is looking to locate in this part of the world will find cut out to be an attractive place i've had number of conversations with leading technology companies and say that the trim simple reason for deciding on a particular location to have that on a dna applies is the talent and the ecosystem that one has a ticker lead today many of these companies they say that twenty five cents of every dollar that they earn is in this part of the world increasingly they want to have a passenger said peasants in this area and we hope that the infrastructure that talent that ecosystem that we have developed will attack them i look forward to engaging with all that few in the coming two days as we exchange ideas and into actions and collaboration thank you very much doctors extra i next speak shoot you she delhi
