so i should do something here and get the slides on her there all right all thank you need to organizers poorer accepting my abstract tourer an oral presentation and i'll try to be as quick as possible i can utilize the ten minutes to the fullest autism spectrum disorder is a new mental disorder with a considerably high prevalence in all populations across the world and boys are times more likely to be affected than girls about fifteen to twenty years ago we used the terminology autism spectrum disorders with an essay that included autism asperger syndrome wreck syndrome disintegrate childhood disorder and the way his basket pervasive the pervasive developmental disorder otherwise early the skier the manual it many will core mental disorders has been revived and the customer dishes out and all these entities are a group now under the term autism spectrum disorder only and became a distinctive entity neurological entity by itself although it might have some autism related features the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are grouped under two categories instead of three like before so there are deaths and or enter action there is a pair there are problems with the reciprocal socialized station non verbal communication like eye contact and posturing as well as men thinning relationships to then repetitive behavior representative usual interpret scented usually in terms of career to pick movements stereotypical peach extreme at herons teens and maybe hyper activity to sensory input startling sometimes on signs are usually or should appeal because the age of three years although they might not be recognized on the social demands or the communication demands go beyond existing capacity so too might be diagnosed later also the diagnosis is delayed usually about two years after the parents raised concerns remarkable thing knowing that early identification is quite important and can be actually per torn between day during the first year of life because it is important because you intervene and treat early the outcome is much better then if you you're late that way patients with the evaluator that there is always a suspicion usually by primary care physician but not unusually to be by the next door neighbor or the teacher or the schooner has done by a multi disciplinary team and the gold standard is to go through i interviewed the mother tie the revised form the autism diagnostic observations casual but there are other things like the checklist for autism to and chad and childhood autism rating scales that cetera but evaluating signs and symptoms of the is not enough you need to measure also i q on the core mobile co morbid conditions and intellectual impairment the treatment usually psycho social educational analysis applied derby analysis speech and language therapy some people and became the use of so the challenge the technology of the to me and said nothing isn't genetic of course because i'm a geneticist but they tell a g people argue about whether there are genetic calls them or mainly environmental we think it's genetic because they're instead of currency rates can come it is there are genetic syndromes that have the as part of that the concordance straighten monitors i got twenty to ninety percent as compared to the dyes i gotta quincy which can percent which is the same as the relative the concurrence very thin models i got the twins was one hundred percent than this will be a purely genetic disorder if it was the euro or less than ten percent or ten percent or less done be totally environmental there are heritability studies that were done and showed that ninety percent of very instant due to genetics a lot of people believe in then byrom and because of the studio academic nature of the recognition of altruism spectrum disorder right now there were some talk about that seems than induction of pregnant action of labor etc what we believe the reality is this is the most effective order where there is a genetic predisposition to autism spectrum disorder there are other factors that can be environmental or genetic that either trigger i can or actually rate or protect against occurrence sentence former gene gene into action and gene environment and their action and epigenetics people believed that the genetic model is there they started look per genetic factors that cause the ten years ago we could identify genetic causes of vs d in ten to fifteen percent of cases but usually are managing orders and about five percent are took location or deletions of chromosomes of what what is known though it became to be known as copy number variants cm dreams a few years ago we could identify genetic causes than twenty five percent managing disorder ten like tragedy acts like that syndrome and like tribbles cultural center cetera and cnvs were found in ten people send thinking gene involvement in the form of the novel five percent now we have better tools actually to even exceed the twenty five percent by using the whole exam sequencing in whole genome sequencing and your head yesterday they said that though genome sequencing is really to revolution and science right now medical genetic santa embarked on a project about six years ago it was to magically time can aim at identification of genes that play ruling started with some capacity building in the chino typing in performance of a dossier dye which are questionnaires and the translation of that into arabic under the patients have that translation into the arabic culture also formation of in house registry to collect all that and coronation about children with autism then we started out doing a comprehensive research program where you astroturf family through abroad through a crowbar and with and provide accurate chino typing by by good evaluation techniques we exclude the non causes of the if d like predilection rats and drone then we do associations studies and also do wgs and or whole genome sequencing and whole axons sequencing so we actually have about one hundred and twenty five tramlines identifies through a pro band with and who are accurately phenotype and all known causes have been excluded including cmv and we included i'll talk to you about the part that's important to a chance twenty trail digs our nuclear families that we performed whole genome sequencing on all members of the families in order to identify genetic causes sixteen families had the mail the problem does a male and female and eleven the background constrained when it so the kursk the curse and elephants have done old genome of the sixty whole genome sequencing data tip four mutations not present in parents present in the children four of them are a novel genes that have not been described to play a role in the two of them are no not to them or sd genes i will not be able to go through them because of the time but they used to explain the sd and sex out of the twenty family the actually so all these mutations work they are not present and parents not present in normal siblings and not present ten five hundred control chromosomes economically meshed with control chromosomes and also predicted to be deleterious by the  to end like ten polish and are not present in the database i hadn't looked at the db cap which contains another one hundred patients world as the and we did not find mutations and these genes and them we did some protein modeling again i won't go through that book for the sake of dime the next tier of the analysis was to look at x length taishan zen were identified another four families with four acts length mutations two of them and known genes are related to as t epilepsy or not specifically were actually in twenty retardation and another two and two novel genes that play big grown and past weighing step may be related to a game but then the strength of our study is that we have contango on its families and these concern families will provide a strong tool for identification of a summer sets of genes that may play a role in autism spectrum disorder and i just put two examples of these families the first class identify its texts mutations that kahlo summer recessive very pattern oven heritage the first one into patched three mutation which was that the luckiest mutation and looks like an interesting mutation but which are from the literature that this gene is quite redundant and even having an illegal in a homozygous format does not cause the problem the second commonly because of the because of how time only one mutation was identikit hide that picking african gene that's called drove over to the first family parents are doubled first cousin and so curse cousin and my last flight i wouldn't go through it but they just want to know what ever i presented today it's actually a work of dozens and dozens of researchers who action where it can i stand over here and take claim for their work thank you very much i'll be glad to question thank you for the title giving a view the just have a three points are questions who thought about mentor dacia and this i mean there are some the believer roses that autism testing person they are more smart so i mean this was depicted and if you see the movie rain man where they show how have a short memory and something proven that autism can lead to being more strong memory and shot upon her reality actually we class that by now what's called autism spectrum disorder and two levels conscience seventy percent of children with the as the you will have impairment thirty percent range for euro graham crumb crumb normal took her normal or or very intelligent i will encourage you to look at the poster that we have about which we followed actually all the nomenclature and called them asperger syndrome three boys who are profoundly intelligent remarkably intelligent and tell have autism spectrum disorder with all its components the social components and the communication but really no link i wish that we deal with because we get it through the cool it 's mostly that children who need services so one hundred percent of our sample with the exception of the family after have and collect shul impairment associated with sd ok and other just comment there was this conspiracy of vaccine which you mention here and they tried in the u s to i think the jury's without that vaccine does not cause trickery about ten to twelve years ago there was a paper that came out and described of vaccination through autism or ies the and actually the study that was being put porn was cut short because they be inappropriate to continue the study without alerting the people's to the problems of the vaccines and its relation to its the however in two thousand and nine i think two thousand and ten united states actually studied this very carefully and there would have been twenty eight cadiz after that original one that fail to replicate the first results the surgeon in two thousand and nine was that they are not going in there are no longer going to fund research about autism and vaccines and closed cage and there are known for me to make a drug for autism i can do that for four i 'm here for cognitive because there are animal model i can do this for the psychoses however for it is there is animal mothers it 's an animal model and actually part about our work is that we delivery the novel genes that we have identified two pelleted with whom we collaborate and the heavens very intricate they induce dna mutations and might and they have an intricate way of measuring the behavior of my and their social interaction and apparently this is a lot very personal for me they put to my son to cages could have a common door and see if they exchange it so shall interactions and and also the stereotypical movement is a fascinating thing
